//! A Scottish Gaelic (GÃ idhlig) date library.

//! # Language Use
//! As this is a bi-lingual library, both languages are used in places on the
//! library. All variables, structures, fields are named in English, because
//! this library is meant to be as accessible to as many people as possible.
//! That being said, as much of the documentation as possible will be in both
//! languages.
